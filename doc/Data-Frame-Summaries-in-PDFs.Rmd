Here are the instructions for setting up [\color{MidnightBlue}{\emph{R
Markdown}}](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) documents in order to generate *pdf*
documents with [\color{MidnightBlue}{data frame
summaries}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/summarytools/vignettes/introduction.html#data-frame-summaries-dfsummary)
(`summarytools::dfSummary()`) that use *png* images.

# 1. The Graphics Problem {#problem}

```{r}
dfSummary(iris[5], headings = FALSE)
```

Although generating *html* or *Word* documents from *Rmd*'s containing
`dfSummary()` outputs is a smooth and painless process, there is a major problem
when it comes to generating *pdf*'s. The graphs, instead of being vertically
centered, appear as though they were sitting on top of all the other cells'
content.

\input{include-renew-cmd.tex}

# 2. The Solution

To correct this issue, we need to redefine the `\includegraphics` command. If
this breaks some other parts of your document[^1], see
[\color{MidnightBlue}{section 2.3}](#robust).

[^1]: There must be a *law of conservation of brokenness* sitting somewhere
    waiting to be formalized (although one could argue that this is merely a
    corollary to [Murphy's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law))

## 2.1 YAML Header

        ---
        title: "My Own Private PDF"
        output: 
          pdf_document: 
            latex_engine: xelatex
            includes:
              in_header: 
              - !expr system.file("includes/fig-valign.tex",
                                  package = "summarytools")
        ---

The solution presented here requires that some *tex* code be included in the
YAML section of the Rmd document. You can use your own *tex* file, or use the
one that is part of the package as of version 1.0 (July 2021). and include it in
from the YAML section using `system.file()`.

The `latex_engine: xelatex` part is not mandatory for the solution to work. But
there are several advantages to using it; I use it systematically and see only
advantages to it, so I can only advise you do the same.

### Using Your Own *tex* File

If you prefer including your own *tex* file, here is what it should (minimally)
contain:

        \usepackage{graphicx}
        \usepackage[export]{adjustbox}
        \usepackage{letltxmacro}
        \LetLtxMacro{\OldIncludegraphics}{\includegraphics}
        \renewcommand{\includegraphics}[2][]{\raisebox{0.5\height}%
          {\OldIncludegraphics[valign=t,#1]{#2}}}

### Modified YAML Section

Supposing you choose to keep the name `fig-valign.tex`, your YAML section should
now look something like this:

        ---
        title: "My Own Private PDF"
        output: 
          pdf_document: 
            latex_engine: xelatex
            includes:
              in_header: fig-valign.tex
        ---

The *tex* file's name is entirely up to you; `fig-valign.tex` is the name used
for the one in **summarytools**' `includes` directory, but it has no special
meaning whatsoever.

## 2.2 Example

Here is a setup chunk which reproduces what has been used for this document,
followed by a call to `dfSummary()`:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(summarytools)
st_options(
  plain.ascii            = FALSE, 
  subtitle.emphasis      = FALSE,
  style                  = "rmarkdown", # For any other summarytools objects 
  dfSummary.style        = "grid",
  dfSummary.graph.magnif = .5,
  dfSummary.valid.col    = FALSE,
  tmp.img.dir            = "/tmp"  # Recommended for Linux/OS X;
                                   # For Windows, using "img" is
                                   # a good habit 
)

define_keywords(title.dfSummary = "Data Frame Summary in PDF Document")
dfSummary(iris)
```

## 2.3 A More Robust Solution {#robust}

If redefining the `\includegraphics` command causes problems elsewhere in your
document, following these instructions should take care of it[^2].

[^2]: File names and locations are suggestions only; adapt the instructions to
    your own needs.

1.  Split the contents of `fig-valign.tex` into two files in your *Rmd*
    document's directory:

    i.  `load-pkgs.tex` -- contains only the first three lines (the
        `\usepackage` commands only)

    ii. `renew-cmd.tex` -- contains the remaining lines, which store the
        existing `\includegraphics` command as a macro and redefine it.

2.  Include the first file with YAML (`\\` indicates line feed):\
    `output: \\ pdf-document: \\ includes: \\ in_header: load-pkgs.tex`

3.  Before the `dfSummary()` chunk(s), paste this *tex* command, also on a new
    line:

        \input{renew-cmd.tex}

4.  After the chunk(s), set the `\includegraphics` back to its original value
    using the following command on a new line:

        \let\includegraphics\OldIncludegraphics

### Proof That `includegraphics` Is Restored to Original

\let\includegraphics\OldIncludegraphics

At this stage, the `\let\includegraphics\OldIncludegraphics` *tex* command has
been executed.

```{r}
dfSummary(iris[5], headings = FALSE)
```

If the operation of restoring the command worked, the results should be back to
being misaligned, just as they were in the
[\color{MidnightBlue}{very first section}](#problem).
