This document shows how to customize the content of the *Stats / Values* column
in [\color{MidnightBlue}{data frame
summaries}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/summarytools/vignettes/introduction.html#data-frame-summaries-dfsummary)
(`summarytools::dfSummary()`) `summarytools::dfSummary()`. This feature was
introduced in version 1.0.0, July 2021.

This feature request [came
up](https://github.com/dcomtois/summarytools/issues/33) several
[times](https://github.com/dcomtois/summarytools/issues/74) in a form or
another, mostly on GitHub.

### How it works

Two new options were created: `dfSummary.custom.1` and `dfSummary.custom.2`. The
first one has a predefined value -- it is the one that makes up the fourth row
of the cell (showing IQR and CV). The second one is set to `NA` by default. If
both options are defined (non-`NA`), the cell will now span on 5 lines rather
than 4, provided there are no additional line breaks occurring.

### Baseline

We'll use the first column of *iris* for this demo. So let's see the results as
they are before making any changes.

First let's set things up:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(knitr)
opts_chunk$set(comment = NA, 
               prompt  = FALSE,
               cache   = FALSE,
               echo    = TRUE,
               results = 'asis')
#knit_theme$set("edit-kwrite")
# https://rclickhandbuch.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/knitrthemesoverview.pdf
library(summarytools)
st_options(plain.ascii     = FALSE,
           headings        = FALSE,
           footnote        = NA,
           round.digits    = 1,
           dfSummary.varnumbers   = FALSE,
           dfSummary.valid.col    = FALSE,
           dfSummary.silent       = TRUE,
           dfSummary.style        = "grid",
           tmp.img.dir            = "img")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#st_css()

```

And then show the baseline:

```{r, results='asis'}
iris_subset <- iris[1]
dfSummary(iris_subset, graph.magnif = .45)
```

## Example 1 - Removing the IQR (CV) line

Setting the first option to `NA` will do just that:

```{r}
st_options(dfSummary.custom.1 = NA)
dfSummary(iris_subset, graph.magnif = .35)
```

## Example 2 : Adding Q1 & Q3

Here we're going to create the expression that is needed to generate the
statistics we want; since this bit of is going to be interpreted while looping
on column data, there are some variables that are available to us. The most
important is, well, `column_data`. Another one that you might want to use is
`round.digits`; we have set it to `1` in the initial chunk.

```{r}
st_options(
  dfSummary.custom.1 = 
    expression(
      paste(
        "Q1 - Q3 :",
        round(
          quantile(column_data,
                   probs = .25,
                   type = 2, 
                   names = FALSE,
                   na.rm = TRUE),
          digits = 1
        ), " - ",
        round(
          quantile(column_data, 
                   probs = .75,
                   type = 2, 
                   names = FALSE,
                   na.rm = TRUE),
          digits = 1
        )
      )
    )           
)
dfSummary(iris_subset, graph.magnif = .45)

```

## Example 3: Inserting back the IQR & CV

It is always possible to revert the first custom stat to its initial value by
using `st_options(dfSummary.custom.1 = "default")`. But let's make things a bit
more interesting by actually showing these under the Q1 & Q3 line that we have
just defined.

```{r}
st_options(
  dfSummary.custom.2 =
    expression(
      paste(
        paste0(
          trs("iqr"), " (", trs("cv"), ") : "
        ),
        format_number(
          IQR(column_data, na.rm = TRUE),
          round.digits
        ),
        " (",
        format_number(
          sd(column_data, na.rm = TRUE) /
              mean(column_data, na.rm = TRUE),
          round.digits
        ),
        ")",
        collapse = "", 
        sep = ""
    )
  )
)
dfSummary(iris_subset, graph.magnif = .65)
```

Don't forget to set `na.rm = TRUE` whenever necessary. Otherwise, just use your
imagination!
